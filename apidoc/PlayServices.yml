summary: Allows a Titanium application or module to use Google Play Services.

    Google Play Services is required by application developers to access Google service APIs such as
    Google Maps, Google Analytics, Firebase, etc.

    ## Getting Started

    Add the module as a dependency to your application by adding a **`<module>`** item to the
    **`<modules>`** element of your `tiapp.xml` file:

        <ti:app>
          ...
          <modules>
            <module platform="android">ti.playservices</module>
          </modules>
          ...
        </ti:app>

    Or include the module as a dependency to a native module by adding a **`<module>`** item to the
    **`<modules>`** element of your `timodule.xml` file:

        <ti:module>
          ...
          <modules>
            <module platform="android">ti.playservices</module>
          </modules>
          ...
        </ti:module>

    Use `require()` to access the module from JavaScript:

        var PlayServices = require('ti.playservices');

    The `PlayServices` variable is a reference to the module. Make API calls using this reference:

        var playServicesAvailable = PlayServices.isGooglePlayServicesAvailable();
